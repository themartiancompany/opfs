Synopsis

Description
===========

This is the manual for the system-wide version
of the 'opfs' Javascript / Typescript library module,
a browser-compatible, OPFS-based
Node / Deno 'fs' module implementation.

Code written using the library seamlessly run
in browsers and in Node.js / Deno environments.

If you stumbled upon this library because
you prefer a Bash-like style for your
Javascript code and you are looking for
a library which allows you the same workflow
of a Bash script, the Crash Javascript [1]_
library is probably what you are looking for.
